ProgrammerError (P|E) is a desktop app for managing students' information, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Designed for CS2100 Lab TAs, this
application is optimized to track personal particulars, emails and lab results of your students across different classes.
If you are familiar with Unix commands, this is definitely for you!

## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick Start
1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `programmerError.jar`
   from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ProgrammerError.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
   contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui_v1.4.png)
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter
   will open the help window.<br>
   Here are some example commands you can try:
    * `add -n Sherwin -sid A1234567X -cid B01 -email e0523451@u.nus.edu`: Adds a student named `Sherwin` to PE with
      his Student ID, Class ID and Email.
    * `edit 1 -n Sherwin`: Updates the name of the student at index 1 (1-indexed) to Sherwin
    * `delete 1`: Deletes the student at index 1 (1-indexed)
    * `filter -sid A1234567X`: Filters the list of students to display the student(s) whose student ID contains `
      A1234567X'
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details on all available commands.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format (Unix Command Syntax):**
- Similar to Unix CLI, the up and down arrow keys can be used to navigate the history of commands executed.
  - Up Arrow Key: Navigate to an older command.
  - Down Arrow Key: Navigate to a more recent command.
  - Command will only be stored after `Enter` has been pressed.
- Flags will be used to specify different options for the commands. For example, the `-sid` flag can be used to specify
  a student's student ID.
- Parameters can be in any order. <br> e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -sid STUDENT_ID`
  , `-sid STUDENT_ID -n NAME`is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last** occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken. <br> e.g. if you specify `-n Allard -n Xian Yi` , only `-n Xian Yi` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `purge`) will be
  ignored. e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## <a name="general-features"></a>1. General Features

### <a name="view-help"></a>1.1 View Help: `help` or F2 on keyboard
Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/commands/HelpCommand/help.png)

### <a name="view-dashboard"></a>1.2 Dashboard: `dashboard`
Displays a dashboard window showing the following data:

1. Number of students
2. Number of classes
3. Number of labs
4. Number of labs unmarked for each class

### <a name="exit"></a>1.3 Exit: `exit` or F1 on keyboard
Exits ProgrammerError and closes the GUI.


## <a name="data-features"></a>2. Data Features

### <a name="fill-sample-data"></a>2.1 Fill Sample Data: `fill`
Fills the program with sample data if no data is already present. Otherwise, throws an error message.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Note:**
As this is a mass operation, it might take a couple of seconds to complete.
</div>

### <a name="purge-all-data"></a>2.2 Purge all Data: `purge`
Clears all data in PE. This can be used to delete pre-existing sample data or existing user data.

### <a name="download-data"></a>2.3 Download Data `download` or F3 on keyboard
All current students' data can be downloaded to a CSV file. The TA will need to select the directory to download the
file to.

### <a name="upload-data"></a>2.4 Upload Data: `upload` or F4 on keyboard
Uploads student data via a CSV file with **only** the following fields: student ID, class ID, name, email 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Note:**
the CSV should *not* contain students' lab results since this functionality is only meant for the TA to automate the adding of students to PE.
    
- As such, simply uploading the CSV obtained via the `download` command will not be accepted
- Furthermore, if there are already existing students, the upload will **overwrite** the existing data rather than append to it.
  This is because in a typical use case, the TA would not want to have the existing data kept if they would like to use student data from their own CSV file.

</div>

In summary:
1. Select a valid CSV file from the file chooser to upload the student data from.
2. A valid CSV file must contain the following column header: `studentId,classId,name,email`
3. Note that this command is not meant for uploading lab results. Rather, it is only for automating the adding of
   students to PE.
