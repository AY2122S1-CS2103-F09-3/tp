### Project: ProgrammerError

[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) (P|E) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 lab
tutors manage their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on administrative
processes and more time teaching students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed with Java and JavaFX.

Please find below my contributions to the project. My contributions to the project code base can also be found at the

#### Features

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter the list of students based on different query parameters.
    * What it does:
Filters the list of students stored in P|E by displaying all the students that matches the query parameters.
Tutors can specify the filter criteria based on any combination of students' particulars.
    * Justification:
So that tutors are able to quickly filter out the students' of interest out of their large number of students using known parameters.
    * Highlights:
This feature was challenging as it involves filtering students based on any combination of query parameters provided.
    
* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
