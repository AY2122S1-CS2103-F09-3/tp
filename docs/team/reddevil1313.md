### Project: ProgrammerError

[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 tutors manage
their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on administrative
processes and more time teaching students.

The following is a summary of my contributions to the
project. ([View Reposense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=reddevil1313)


### Features

1. **Added the ability to purge existing data and fill it with using sample data**
  - What it does: Allows the TA to purge existing data using the purge command and fill it with sample data
    using the fill command.
  - Justification: So that the TA can remove existing data to input his/her own data or try out the commands
    on a sample database.
  - Highlights: This feature seemed simple at first as it just required to modify the existing clear feature
    but the fill command required understanding of how the data was stored in the json file and how to perform
    checks on whether the program already had data or not.
2. **Added the ability to add labs and edit their details for the entire student base**
  - What it does: Allows the TA to add and edit labs ranging from 0 to 14 for the entire student base in the 
    application.
  - Justification: Primary purpose of the application; So that the TA can keep track of the scores of 
    labs under him/her.
  - Highlights: This feature posed various challenges along the way. Earlier we had implemented the attributes
    of the Lab class using data values but then shifted to wrapper classes which required very tedious refactoring
    and debugging as a lot of unwanted bugs came about. Changes made to the storing of the data in the json file
    to accomodate for the new labs encountered a lot of bugs as well.
3. **Added the ability to store individual grades for each student**
  - What it does: Allows the TA to edit individual grades for each student in the program.
  - Justification: So that the TA can keep track of how many labs he/she has marked and how many of them
    are still left to mark. 
  - Highlights: This feature required changes to the existing edit command and thus, understanding of 
    the command's optional inputs. One of the major highlights was solving a bug where once a newly 
    added lab was edited for one student, it was being edited to all.
