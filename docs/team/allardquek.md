[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 tutors manage their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on administrative processes and more time teaching students.

The following is a summary of my contributions to the project. Visit this [Reposense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=allardquek) for more details.

#### Features
1. Added the ability to upload student data (Credits: [opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/), Stackoverflow)
    - What it does: Allows the TA to upload a CSV file containing students' student ID, class ID, name and email 
    - Justification: So that the TA can automate the process of adding students to their classes without having to manually type the add command
    - Highlights: Trying out different third-party libraries and evaluating their usefulness (e.g. based on their size, ease-of-use, functionality offered). 
      Validating the user input, since there are many invalid formats and inputs possible
2. Added the ability to download student data (Credits: [org.json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) (third-party library), Stackoverflow)
    - What it does: Allows the TA to download the current student data into a CSV format
    - Justification: So that the TA can upload the students' lab results onto Luminus gradebook or share with other TAs.
    - Highlights: Integrating a third-party library into the project for the first time. Encountered issues integrating different libraries into the project dependencies. 
      Getting the display of the popup message to be precise and appealing (required working on the Ui and exploring CSS properties)
3. Added the ability to view a dashboard of student and lab data
    - What it does: Shows the total number of students, labs and classes, as well as the number of labs left to marked for each class
    - Justification: So that the TA can track their progress in marking their students' labs conveniently, especially when they have many students
    - Highlights: Used a TreeMap to store the students' lab data since no database usage was allowed for this project. Learnt more about CSS to make the dashboard interface more user-friendly using colour schemes and visibility properties of javafx components
