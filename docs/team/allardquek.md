[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 tutors manage
their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on administrative
processes and more time teaching students.

The following is a summary of my contributions to the
project. ([View Reposense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=allardquek))

#### Features

1. **Added the ability to upload student data**
    - What it does: Allows the TA to upload a CSV file containing students' student ID, class ID, name and email
    - Justification: So that the TA can automate the process of adding students to their classes without having to
      manually type the add command
    - Highlights: This feature involved trying out different third-party libraries and evaluating their suitability (
      e.g. based on their size, ease-of-use, functionality offered). Challenges included handling the multiple
      possibilities for invalid user input with intuitive error messages and good design.
    - Credits: [opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) (third-party library), Stackoverflow
2. **Added the ability to download student data**
    - What it does: Allows the TA to download the current student data into a CSV format
    - Justification: So that the TA can upload the students' lab results onto Luminus gradebook or share them with other
      TAs.
    - Highlights: This feature was challenging as it required integrating a third-party library into the project for the
      first time and ensuring the feature works across different devices. To improve the user experience, I also created
      a popup message to be which required significant exploration with CSS properties and display sizes.
    - Credits: [org.json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) (third-party library), Stackoverflow
3. **Added the ability to view a dashboard of student and lab data**
    - What it does: Shows the total number of students, labs and classes, as well as the number of labs left to marked
      for each class
    - Justification: So that the TA can track their progress in marking their students' labs conveniently, especially
      when they have many students
    - Highlights: This feature required a unique solution to overcome the project constraint of not using a database by
      using a TreeMap to store and retrieve students' lab data. Additionally, this feature required learning more about
      javafx components and CSS properties to make the dashboard interface more user-friendly.
